### Benefits

In addition to competitive pay and equity, [we provide many benefits](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers#benefits) to keep you happy, healthy, and productive.

### About the role

Sourcegraph’s mission is to give developers the power to build a better future. In a product manager, we’re looking for someone who shares this mission and can help our team achieve it.

You will:

- Devise, implement, and improve the processes (including by writing code to do so) to ensure our product solves our customers' problems by:
  - Collecting the necessary context and information (such as requirements, use cases, user stories, error messages, etc.) for our planned work.
  - Helping teammates answer product questions by collecting feedback and privacy-respectful usage metrics from users.
  - Providing customers with an easy way to give input on our priorities and understand how each release or feature affects them.
  - Improving response time and follow-through on feedback and communications received from customers
  - Educating and empowering teammates to form response habits and product mentalities that help surface problems more quickly, and provide greater insight into requests across the organization.
- Help teammates understand product strategy/principles and the positive impact of their work on customers and on our company.
- Implement product improvements (by writing code subject to the same standards as for all other code we ship) directly when you deem that to be the most efficient way to answer questions for our team or get something done. (For example, hacking on [Sourcegraph extensions](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions) to elicit useful feedback from customers or quickly solve customer problems.)
- Work with the CEO (who is also the Head of Product) to set the product roadmap and make long-term prioritization decisions.
- Be transparent in your internal and external communication. Sourcegraph is open source, and most discussion occurs in public, or in channels where you communicate directly with our customers.

### Ideal candidates have

- Strong technical background, with experience working as a software engineer
- Experience, or interest in, working with a distributed team
- Excellent communication and technical writing skills
- Ability to stay focused on goals
- Deep passion for developer tools and productivity enhancements

### Why this role is special

- You'll be our first product manager, with huge responsibility and opportunity for growth.
- Our product has extremely high engagement relative to most products (especially enterprise products). We get enormous amounts of user feedback from our unusually thoughtful user base.
- You'll be writing a lot of code to do your job, both to implement the processes described above and to make product improvements and experiments directly.
- Our developers use the product, so they care deeply about product matters. You won't be fighting apathy.
